<b>punk records</b>

welcome to the punk records official documentation
i'm trying to keep this documentation consise , so you can read through it in 5 minutes and become an expert . lets get started

punk records uses a command line interface , meaning you type instead of clicking

to test your understanding of this concept , type 'i am entering a command' into the box below , then press enter 

<textarea  placeholder='type here' id='input' style='border:1px solid hsla(0,0%,0%,0.7);width:15vw;height:1.5em;padding:10px'></textarea>

<span id='testtext'  style='display:none'>




</div>


<div class='chapter' id='navigation'>

<b>navigation</b>

with these two words , navigation of the entire program is possible ↓

1 type <b>help</b> to see where you can go
2 type <b>exit</b> to go back to where you were

you can always <span id='clickpress'>click</span> on the help results if you don't feel like typing them out

</div>



<div class='chapter' id='search'>

<b>search</b>

punk records is a portal into the internet ; aka a ' search bar '

if you want to look something up : just type it and press enter . 

if you want to look up multiple things at the same time : type them out with each search separated by a comma , then press enter . 

ex for making multiple searches :

kant , hagel , kant vs hagel ← will make three searches in seperate tabs

tip : hold the control key when pressing enter to go straight to the first ( duckduckgo ) search result

</div>


<div class='chapter' id='search-engine'> 

<b>search engine</b>

the default search engine can be selected in the settings menu

you can also declare a search engine for a single search by prepending the search with the coresponding letter .

g = google
d = duckduckgo
y = youtube
w = wikipedia

ex if you wanted to look up mushroom on wikepedia :

w mushroom ← this will direct you to the wikipedia page on mushrooms

tip : you can make multiple searches with different engines by seperating each search with a comma , and prepending each search with the letter of the engine

</div>


<div class='chapter' id='theme'>

<b>theme</b>

theme settings are based in CSS , so you can <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.php'> format colors in any way CSS understands </a>

there are a few secret options in the theme menu

they come in the form of additional perameters for the existing settings . here are the syntaxes

color : ( main color ) ( link color ) ( input color )
background : ( background color or image link ) ( <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_background-size.php'>background image size settings</a> ) ( image size settings again , use '' ( two quotes ) to omit ) ( <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-position.php'>background image position settings</a> ) ( image position settings again )
font : ( font ) ( <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_font_weight.php'> weight </a> ) ( <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode'>blending mode</a> )

if you want to keep certain perameters the same , use '' ( two quotes ) as the perameter .

ex if you wanted black text, white input and to keep links the same :

type → color black '' white

tip : you can use '' to get the current theme settings ex : font '' '' '' would return your current font settings .

</div>

<div class='chapter' id='layout'>

<b>layout</b>

similar to theme , layout changes the way punk records looks . 

in an effort to keep dignified users from cluttering their workspace with useless content , layout allows you to remove elements from the interface . 

</div>


<div class='chapter' id='login'>

<b>login</b>

you can login and create accounts using the command /l

without logging in , there is a limited amount of memory for you to save things , so the anonymous ( not logged in ) menu is focused more on being a search bar .

when logged in , commands lose their / prefix , and there are a few more commands available , at the moment : s & b ; are the single letter commands available when logged in .

one day i hope that : s , b , n , i , f will all be commands available to logged in users .

</div>

<div class='chapter' id='setting-as-homepage'>

<b>setting punk records as your homepage</b>

since it works as a search bar , punk records can be set to your browsers homepage .

certain browsers allow this by default , while others require a bit of work .

i'll try to provide some solutions for popular browsers here .

firefox allows you to set a custom homepage , but not a custom new tab page ( if that makes any sense ) . so to set punk records as your default page in firefox , you need an extension . there are a few on the <a href='http://addons.mozilla.com/'>mozilla plugins directory</a> including <a href='https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/new-tab-custom-url/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_conten'>one made by me</a> .

looks like chrome is the same as firefox , so i'll make an extension one day , but for now : you will need to download a <a href='https://chromewebstore.google.com/'> plugin</a> .

for safari it looks like you can do it . open preferences , select general , then 'new tabs open with' . select 'homepage' and input 'https://xerelia.ca/punk' .

okay i guess there are a lot of browsers , but hopefully if you are using anything else you can figure it out .

</div>


<div class='chapter' id='privacy'>

<b>privacy</b>

punk records does not store passwords in plain text , nor is there any way for me to decypher users passwords .

through the backend , it is technically possible for me to view stored user data ( files notes etc ) , but i have absolutely no way of knowing what anyones password actually is .

since i cant see your passwords i presume hackers cannot either , but since i can see your saved data i presume hackers could see that if they really wanted to .

so at the moment , since i have not developed encryption on user inputed data , dont save any information you wouldnt want hackers or myself to see .

basically use any password you want , but dont use punk records to remember your passwords or your visa number or anything like that , yet .

i do plan on eventually encrypting everything , but for now only passwords are encrypted , the rest is stored securely on my server , although in plain text .

data is not shared or sold in any capacity , it is my goal to keep user data safe and private
